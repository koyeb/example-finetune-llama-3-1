Using Streams
*************


Specifying the "Stream"
=======================

All operations (including random number generation) take an optional
keyword argument "stream". The "stream" kwarg specifies which "Stream"
the operation should run on. If the stream is unspecified then the
operation is run on the default stream of the default device:
"mx.default_stream(mx.default_device())".  The "stream" kwarg can also
be a "Device" (e.g. "stream=my_device") in which case the operation is
run on the default stream of the provided device
"mx.default_stream(my_device)".
