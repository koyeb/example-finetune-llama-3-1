mlx.nn.Dropout3d
****************

class Dropout3d(p: float = 0.5)

   Apply 3D channel-wise dropout during training.

   Randomly zero out entire channels independently with probability p.
   This layer expects the channels to be last, i.e., the input shape
   should be *NDHWC* or *DHWC* where: *N* is the batch dimension, *D*
   is the depth, *H* is the input image height, *W* is the input image
   width, and *C* is the number of input channels.

   The remaining channels are scaled by \frac{1}{1-p} to maintain the
   expected value of each element. Unlike traditional dropout, which
   zeros individual entries, this layer zeros entire channels. This is
   often beneficial for convolutional layers processing 3D data, like
   in medical imaging or video processing.

   Parameters:
      **p** (*float*) -- Probability of zeroing a channel during
      training.
