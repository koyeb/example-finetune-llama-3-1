*****************

fftn(a: array, s: Sequence[int] | None = None, axes: Sequence[int] | None = None, stream: Stream | Device | None = None) -> array

   n-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- The input array.

      * **s** (*list**(**int**)**, **optional*) -- Sizes of the
        transformed axes. The corresponding axes in the input are
        truncated or padded with zeros to match the sizes in "s". The
        default value is the sizes of "a" along "axes".

      * **axes** (*list**(**int**)**, **optional*) -- Axes along which
        to perform the FFT. The default is "None" in which case the
        FFT is over the last "len(s)" axes are or all axes if "s" is
        also "None".

   Returns:
      The DFT of the input along the given axes.

   Return type:
      *array*
