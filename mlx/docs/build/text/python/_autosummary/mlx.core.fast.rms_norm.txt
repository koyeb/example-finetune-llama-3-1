**********************

rms_norm(x: array, weight: array, eps: float, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Root Mean Square normalization (RMS norm).

   The normalization is with respect to the last axis of the input
   "x".

   Parameters:
      * **x** (*array*) -- Input array.

      * **weight** (*array*) -- A multiplicative weight to scale the
        result by. The "weight" should be one-dimensional with the
        same size as the last axis of "x".

      * **eps** (*float*) -- A small additive constant for numerical
        stability.

   Returns:
      The output array.

   Return type:
      *array*
