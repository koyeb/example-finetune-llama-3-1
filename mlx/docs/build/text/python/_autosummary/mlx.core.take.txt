mlx.core.take
*************

take(a: array, /, indices: array, axis: int | None = None, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Take elements along an axis.

   The elements are taken from "indices" along the specified axis. If
   the axis is not specified the array is treated as a flattened 1-D
   array prior to performing the take.

   As an example, if the "axis=1" this is equivalent to "a[:, indices,
   ...]".

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- Input array.

      * **indices** (*array*) -- Input array with integral type.

      * **axis** (*int**, **optional*) -- Axis along which to perform
        the take. If unspecified the array is treated as a flattened
        1-D vector.

   Returns:
      The indexed values of "a".

   Return type:
      *array*
