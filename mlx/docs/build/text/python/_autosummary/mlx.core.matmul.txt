matmul(a: array, b: array, /, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Matrix multiplication.

   Perform the (possibly batched) matrix multiplication of two arrays.
   This function supports broadcasting for arrays with more than two
   dimensions.

   * If the first array is 1-D then a 1 is prepended to its shape to
     make it a matrix. Similarly if the second array is 1-D then a 1
     is appended to its shape to make it a matrix. In either case the
     singleton dimension is removed from the result.

   * A batched matrix multiplication is performed if the arrays have
     more than 2 dimensions.  The matrix dimensions for the matrix
     product are the last two dimensions of each input.

   * All but the last two dimensions of each input are broadcast with
     one another using standard numpy-style broadcasting semantics.

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- Input array or scalar.

      * **b** (*array*) -- Input array or scalar.

   Returns:
      The matrix product of "a" and "b".

   Return type:
      *array*
