mlx.utils.tree_reduce
*********************

tree_reduce(fn, tree, initializer=None, is_leaf=None)

   Applies a reduction to the leaves of a Python tree.

   This function reduces Python trees into an accumulated result by
   applying the provided function "fn" to the leaves of the tree.

   -[ Example ]-

   >>> from mlx.utils import tree_reduce
   >>> tree = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5]}
   >>> tree_reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x, tree, 0)
   15

   Parameters:
      * **fn** (*callable*) -- The reducer function that takes two
        arguments (accumulator, current value) and returns the updated
        accumulator.

      * **tree** (*Any*) -- The Python tree to reduce. It can be any
        nested combination of lists, tuples, or dictionaries.

      * **initializer** (*Any**, **optional*) -- The initial value to
        start the reduction. If not provided, the first leaf value is
        used.

      * **is_leaf** (*callable**, **optional*) -- A function to
        determine if an object is a leaf, returning "True" for leaf
        nodes and "False" otherwise.

   Returns:
      The accumulated value.

   Return type:
      *Any*
