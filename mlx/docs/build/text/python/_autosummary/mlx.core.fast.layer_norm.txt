************************

layer_norm(x: array, weight: array | None, bias: array | None, eps: float, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Layer normalization.

   The normalization is with respect to the last axis of the input
   "x".

   Parameters:
      * **x** (*array*) -- Input array.

      * **weight** (*array**, **optional*) -- A multiplicative weight
        to scale the result by. The "weight" should be one-dimensional
        with the same size as the last axis of "x". If set to "None"
        then no scaling happens.

      * **bias** (*array**, **optional*) -- An additive offset to be
        added to the result. The "bias" should be one-dimensional with
        the same size as the last axis of "x". If set to "None" then
        no translation happens.

      * **eps** (*float*) -- A small additive constant for numerical
        stability.

   Returns:
      The output array.

   Return type:
      *array*
