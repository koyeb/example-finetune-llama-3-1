mlx.core.linalg.svd
*******************

svd(a: array, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None)

   The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the input matrix.

   This function supports arrays with at least 2 dimensions. When the
   input has more than two dimensions, the function iterates over all
   indices of the first a.ndim - 2 dimensions and for each combination
   SVD is applied to the last two indices.

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- Input array.

      * **stream** (*Stream**, **optional*) -- Stream or device.
        Defaults to "None" in which case the default stream of the
        default device is used.

   Returns:
      The "U", "S", and "Vt" matrices, such that "A = U @ diag(S) @
      Vt"

   Return type:
      *tuple*(*array*, *array*, *array*)
