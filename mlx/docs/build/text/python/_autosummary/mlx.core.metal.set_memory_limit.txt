mlx.core.metal.set_memory_limit
*******************************

set_memory_limit(limit: int, *, relaxed: bool = True) -> int

   Set the memory limit.

   Memory allocations will wait on scheduled tasks to complete if the
   limit is exceeded. If there are no more scheduled tasks an error
   will be raised if "relaxed" is "False". Otherwise memory will be
   allocated (including the potential for swap) if "relaxed" is
   "True".

   The memory limit defaults to 1.5 times the maximum recommended
   working set size reported by the device.

   Parameters:
      * **limit** (*int*) -- Memory limit in bytes.

      * **relaxed** (*bool**, **optional*) -- If *False`* an error is
        raised if the limit is exceeded. Default: "True"

   Returns:
      The previous memory limit in bytes.

   Return type:
      *int*
