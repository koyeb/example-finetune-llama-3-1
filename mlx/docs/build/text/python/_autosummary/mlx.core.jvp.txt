jvp(fun: callable, primals: List[array], tangents: List[array]) -> Tuple[List[array], List[array]]

   Compute the Jacobian-vector product.

   This computes the product of the Jacobian of a function "fun"
   evaluated at "primals" with the "tangents".

   Parameters:
      * **fun** (*callable*) -- A function which takes a variable
        number of "array" and returns a single "array" or list of
        "array".

      * **primals** (*list**(**array**)*) -- A list of "array" at
        which to evaluate the Jacobian.

      * **tangents** (*list**(**array**)*) -- A list of "array" which
        are the "vector" in the Jacobian-vector product. The
        "tangents" should be the same in number, shape, and type as
        the inputs of "fun" (i.e. the "primals").

   Returns:
      A list of the Jacobian-vector products which is the same in
      number, shape, and type of the inputs to "fun".

   Return type:
      *list*(*array*)
