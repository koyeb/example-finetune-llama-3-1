****************

compile(fun: Callable, inputs: object | None = None, outputs: object | None = None, shapeless: bool = False) -> object

   Returns a compiled function which produces the same output as
   "fun".

   Parameters:
      * **fun** (*callable*) -- A function which takes a variable
        number of "array" or trees of "array" and returns a variable
        number of "array" or trees of "array".

      * **inputs** (*list** or **dict**, **optional*) -- These inputs
        will be captured during the function compilation along with
        the inputs to "fun". The "inputs" can be a "list" or a "dict"
        containing arbitrarily nested lists, dictionaries, or arrays.
        Leaf nodes that are not "array" are ignored. Default: "None"

      * **outputs** (*list** or **dict**, **optional*) -- These
        outputs will be captured and updated in a compiled function.
        The "outputs" can be a "list" or a "dict" containing
        arbitrarily nested lists, dictionaries, or arrays. Leaf nodes
        that are not "array" are ignored. Default: "None"

      * **shapeless** (*bool**, **optional*) -- A function compiled
        with the "shapeless" option enabled will not be recompiled
        when the input shape changes. Not all functions can be
        compiled with "shapeless" enabled. Attempting to compile such
        functions with shapeless enabled will throw. Note, changing
        the number of dimensions or type of any input will result in a
        recompilation even with "shapeless" set to "True". Default:
        "False"

   Returns:
      A compiled function which has the same input arguments as "fun"
      and returns the the same output(s).

   Return type:
      callable
