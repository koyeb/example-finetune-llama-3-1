mlx.core.fft.irfft2
*******************

irfft2(a: array, s: Sequence[int] | None = None, axes: Sequence[int] | None = [-2, -1], stream: Stream | Device | None = None) -> array

   The inverse of "rfft2()".

   Note the input is generally complex. The dimensions of the input
   specified in "axes" are padded or truncated to match the sizes from
   "s". The last axis in "axes" is treated as the real axis and will
   have size "s[-1] // 2 + 1".

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- The input array.

      * **s** (*list**(**int**)**, **optional*) -- Sizes of the
        transformed axes. The corresponding axes in the input are
        truncated or padded with zeros to match the sizes in "s"
        except for the last axis which has size "s[-1] // 2 + 1". The
        default value is the sizes of "a" along "axes".

      * **axes** (*list**(**int**)**, **optional*) -- Axes along which
        to perform the FFT. The default is "[-2, -1]".

   Returns:
      The real array containing the inverse of "rfft2()".

   Return type:
      *array*
