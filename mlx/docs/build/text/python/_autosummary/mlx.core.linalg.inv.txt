mlx.core.linalg.inv
*******************

inv(a: array, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Compute the inverse of a square matrix.

   This function supports arrays with at least 2 dimensions. When the
   input has more than two dimensions, the inverse is computed for
   each matrix in the last two dimensions of "a".

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- Input array.

      * **stream** (*Stream**, **optional*) -- Stream or device.
        Defaults to "None" in which case the default stream of the
        default device is used.

   Returns:
      "ainv" such that "dot(a, ainv) = dot(ainv, a) = eye(a.shape[0])"

   Return type:
      *array*
