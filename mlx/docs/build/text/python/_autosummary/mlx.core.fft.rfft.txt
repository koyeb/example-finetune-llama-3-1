*****************

rfft(a: array, n: int | None = None, axis: int = -1, stream: Stream | Device | None = None) -> array

   One dimensional discrete Fourier Transform on a real input.

   The output has the same shape as the input except along "axis" in
   which case it has size "n // 2 + 1".

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- The input array. If the array is complex it
        will be silently cast to a real type.

      * **n** (*int**, **optional*) -- Size of the transformed axis.
        The corresponding axis in the input is truncated or padded
        with zeros to match "n". The default value is "a.shape[axis]".

      * **axis** (*int**, **optional*) -- Axis along which to perform
        the FFT. The default is "-1".

   Returns:
      The DFT of the input along the given axis. The output data type
      will be complex.

   Return type:
      *array*
