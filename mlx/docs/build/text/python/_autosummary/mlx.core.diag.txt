*************

diag(a: array, /, k: int = 0, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Extract a diagonal or construct a diagonal matrix. If "a" is 1-D
   then a diagonal matrix is constructed with "a" on the k-th
   diagonal. If "a" is 2-D then the k-th diagonal is returned.

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- 1-D or 2-D input array.

      * **k** (*int**, **optional*) -- The diagonal to extract or
        construct. Default: "0".

   Returns:
      The extracted diagonal or the constructed diagonal matrix.

   Return type:
      *array*
