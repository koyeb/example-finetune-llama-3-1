mlx.core.diagonal
*****************

diagonal(a: array, offset: int = 0, axis1: int = 0, axis2: int = 1, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Return specified diagonals.

   If "a" is 2-D, then a 1-D array containing the diagonal at the
   given "offset" is returned.

   If "a" has more than two dimensions, then "axis1" and "axis2"
   determine the 2D subarrays from which diagonals are extracted. The
   new shape is the original shape with "axis1" and "axis2" removed
   and a new dimension inserted at the end corresponding to the
   diagonal.

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- Input array

      * **offset** (*int**, **optional*) -- Offset of the diagonal
        from the main diagonal. Can be positive or negative. Default:
        "0".

      * **axis1** (*int**, **optional*) -- The first axis of the 2-D
        sub-arrays from which the diagonals should be taken. Default:
        "0".

      * **axis2** (*int**, **optional*) -- The second axis of the 2-D
        sub-arrays from which the diagonals should be taken. Default:
        "1".

   Returns:
      The diagonals of the array.

   Return type:
      *array*
