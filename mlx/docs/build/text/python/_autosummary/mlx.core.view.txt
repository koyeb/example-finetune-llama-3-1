*************

view(a: scalar | array, dtype: Dtype, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   View the array as a different type.

   The output shape changes along the last axis if the input array's
   type and the input "dtype" do not have the same size.

   Note: the view op does not imply that the input and output arrays
   share their underlying data. The view only gaurantees that the
   binary representation of each element (or group of elements) is the
   same.

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- Input array or scalar.

      * **dtype** (*Dtype*) -- The data type to change to.

   Returns:
      The array with the new type.

   Return type:
      *array*
