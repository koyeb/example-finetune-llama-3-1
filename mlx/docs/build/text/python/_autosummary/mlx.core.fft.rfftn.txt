******************

rfftn(a: array, s: Sequence[int] | None = None, axes: Sequence[int] | None = None, stream: Stream | Device | None = None) -> array

   n-dimensional real discrete Fourier Transform.

   The output has the same shape as the input except along the
   dimensions in "axes" in which case it has sizes from "s". The last
   axis in "axes" is treated as the real axis and will have size
   "s[-1] // 2 + 1".

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- The input array. If the array is complex it
        will be silently cast to a real type.

      * **s** (*list**(**int**)**, **optional*) -- Sizes of the
        transformed axes. The corresponding axes in the input are
        truncated or padded with zeros to match the sizes in "s". The
        default value is the sizes of "a" along "axes".

      * **axes** (*list**(**int**)**, **optional*) -- Axes along which
        to perform the FFT. The default is "None" in which case the
        FFT is over the last "len(s)" axes or all axes if "s" is also
        "None".

   Returns:
      The real DFT of the input along the given axes. The output

   Return type:
      *array*
