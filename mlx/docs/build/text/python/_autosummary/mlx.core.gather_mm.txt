mlx.core.gather_mm
******************

gather_mm(a: array, b: array, /, lhs_indices: array, rhs_indices: array, *, stream: None | Stream | Device = None) -> array

   Matrix multiplication with matrix-level gather.

   Performs a gather of the operands with the given indices followed
   by a (possibly batched) matrix multiplication of two arrays.  This
   operation is more efficient than explicitly applying a "take()"
   followed by a "matmul()".

   The indices "lhs_indices" and "rhs_indices" contain flat indices
   along the batch dimensions (i.e. all but the last two dimensions)
   of "a" and "b" respectively.

   For "a" with shape "(A1, A2, ..., AS, M, K)", "lhs_indices"
   contains indices from the range "[0, A1 * A2 * ... * AS)"

   For "b" with shape "(B1, B2, ..., BS, M, K)", "rhs_indices"
   contains indices from the range "[0, B1 * B2 * ... * BS)"

   Parameters:
      * **a** (*array*) -- Input array.

      * **b** (*array*) -- Input array.

      * **lhs_indices** (*array**, **optional*) -- Integer indices for
        "a". Default: "None"

      * **rhs_indices** (*array**, **optional*) -- Integer indices for
        "b". Default: "None"

   Returns:
      The output array.

   Return type:
      *array*
